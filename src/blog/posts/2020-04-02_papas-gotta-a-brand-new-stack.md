I promised myself that today, April 1, 2020 would be the first day I write something on a new blog. I have been procrastinating for way too long. 

This is the very first post for me using a new platform. I have been using WordPress for about 15 years, Movable Type before that, and before that, something I built myself with Filemaker and Lasso. 

The new blog is built on a JamStack foundation with the following:
* GatsbyJS for most of the site structure and organization
* NetlifyCMS for managing the pages and as a headless CMS
* A bunch of node modules and plug-ins too many to mention

Don't get me wrong. I love WordPress. It's an amazing platform and has been really good to me. In fact, I'm still using it for my comedy production site [Showmentum](https://www.showmentum.com). Untill I find a viable solution for WooCommerce and Event Tickets, I'll be stuck.

The main reason I'm switing to the JamStack, headless CMS site is because I like to customize my sites. While WordPress is great for people who don't like or know web development. I've been working on websites since 1993 and all those plugins and templates just slow me down. While they can do some amazing things, it's hard to get them to _not_ do something as well.

For me the ideal workflow is to have a fully functioning version of my site running on my local machine. It's way faster to make changes and check your work. Also, if you mess things up, you don't mess up your live site. 

Here are a few more reasons, which I might go into detail in future blog posts:
* It doesn't require a database
* The whole site is static, so it's way way faster than a dynamic site
* It's easy to make multiple versions, or stages of a site
* The content in the site can be version controlled with Git
