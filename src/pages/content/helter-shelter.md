I'm starging a new site while I've been keeping busy during California's Shelter-in-place order. Yesterday, we were told it's going to go on at least until May 3.

When we reach that date, shit is going to be off the hook.

I’m using my iPad to create content for this page. The experience isn’t awful. I still don’t know what to think of the environment. It’s best to just get writing and get this over with.
